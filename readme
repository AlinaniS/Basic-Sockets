..so the code implement here is about sockets, how to devices are able to communicate with each other in a client-server model
..message sending isn't dynamic as the messages sent, are hardcoded before being sent, find an implementation to send messages
dynamically for both local and over the internet...
..Server2 has proper functionality for sockets, apply more knowledge on server.py

Redo the whole thing with your crazy implementations of dynamicism and see how far you can stretch the concepts you've just learned.
